# Note
It won't work anymore because perlexity.ai uses cloudfare now. I will rewrite it, if perpelxity.ai will provide open API.

# How to use
This program requires ```requests``` and ```websocket-client``` libraries. So if you don't use them, you should install them with pip.
You can clone this project and run it with ```python terminal_assistant``` or download Windows build from Release page.

When you start a program you should to choose available model, hit enter and then start communication with bot.<br>
For sure you need internet connection.<br>

After you wrote your request, hit ENTER key twice and then get response.
